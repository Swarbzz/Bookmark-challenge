### Bookmark Challenge

#### User story 1
as a user
so that i can select my bookmarks
I would like to see a list of bookmarks.

Domain model: 
|Bookmark|
|--------|
|@bookmark|
|list(bookmark)|

Or a far better domain model can be found ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makersacademy/course/master/bookmark_manager/images/bookmark_manager_1.png?token=AOJN3ONUCUQMNCDQMRSAULS6N5TOO)
